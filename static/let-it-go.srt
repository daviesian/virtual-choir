00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:17,000
The snow glows white on the mountain tonight,

1
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:20,000
not a footprint to be seen

2
00:00:20,500 --> 00:00:23,500
A kingdom of isolation,

3
00:00:23,500 --> 00:00:27,000
and it looks like I'm the queen

4
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:34,000
The wind is howling like this swirling storm inside

5
00:00:34,500 --> 00:00:41,000
Couldn't keep it in, heaven knows I tried

6
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:46,000
Don't let them in, don't let them see

7
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:49,500
Be the good girl you always had to be

8
00:00:49,500 --> 00:00:54,000
Conceal, don't feel, don't let them know

9
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:58,000
Well, now they know!

10
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:02,000
Let it go, let it go!

11
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:06,000
Can't hold it back any more!

12
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:09,500
Let it go, let it go!

13
00:01:09,500 --> 00:01:13,000
Turn away and slam the door!

14
00:01:13,500 --> 00:01:19,500
I don't care what they're going to say

15
00:01:19,500 --> 00:01:24,000
Let the storm rage on

16
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:27,000
The cold never bothered me anyway.

17
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:33,500
It's funny how some distance

18
00:01:33,500 --> 00:01:37,000
Makes everything seem small

19
00:01:37,500 --> 00:01:41,000
And the fears that once controlled me

20
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Can't get to me at all!

21
00:01:45,500 --> 00:01:49,000
It's time to see what I can do

22
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:52,500
To test the limits and break through

23
00:01:52,500 --> 00:01:56,500
No right, no wrong, no rules for me

24
00:01:56,500 --> 00:01:59,500
I'm free!

25
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:03,500
Let it go, let it go!

26
00:02:03,500 --> 00:02:07,500
I am one with the wind and sky

27
00:02:07,500 --> 00:02:11,000
Let it go, let it go!

28
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:15,000
You'll never see me cry

29
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:21,500
Here I stand, and here I'll stay,

30
00:02:21,500 --> 00:02:25,000
Let the storm rage on...

31
00:02:32,500 --> 00:02:39,000
My power flurries through the air and to the ground

32
00:02:39,500 --> 00:02:46,000
My soul is spiralling in frozen fractals all around

33
00:02:46,500 --> 00:02:53,000
And one thought crystallizes like an icy blast

34
00:02:53,500 --> 00:02:56,500
I'm never going back

35
00:02:56,500 --> 00:03:00,500
The past is in the past!

36
00:03:01,500 --> 00:03:04,500
Let it go, let it go!

37
00:03:04,500 --> 00:03:08,500
And I'll rise like the break of dawn

38
00:03:08,500 --> 00:03:12,000
Let it go, let it go!

39
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:15,500
That perfect girl is gone

40
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:24,500
Here I stand in the light of day

41
00:03:24,500 --> 00:03:30,000
Let the storm rage on!

42
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:33,500
The cold never bothered me anyway.
